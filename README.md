# Event Manager
The project is a practice of ERB, being built following [the tutorial on Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html).<br><br>
The goal is to manipulate content from CSV, and gain additional data with Sunlight Congress gem. <br>
Finally use ERB to generate form letters, and output them to individual html files.
